scripts used to generate the csv files making up the ProteomeVis web app (github.com/rrazban/proteomevis/make_database)

order in which executables should be run to regenerate the data are indicated by 0, 1, 2 labels at the start of the directory name
if no numbers are present, then can run in any order

in general, executables are run within an organism's dir
